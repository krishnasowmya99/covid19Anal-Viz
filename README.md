COVID-19 Dataset Analysis

This project aims to streamline and analyze the COVID-19 dataset by eliminating unnecessary columns, consolidating rows, and merging with the World Happiness Report. By doing so, we were able to uncover valuable correlations and derive meaningful insights from the data.
Key Highlights

    Streamlining the Dataset: Optimized the COVID-19 dataset by removing 20% of the columns that were not relevant to the analysis. This helped in reducing data clutter and improving the overall efficiency of the analysis.

    Data Consolidation: Consolidated the COVID-19 dataset by merging and grouping rows to create a more concise and informative dataset. This consolidation allowed me to focus on key metrics and trends, enhancing the accuracy of the analysis.

    Calculation of Essential Metrics: Computed essential metrics from the COVID-19 dataset, which provided valuable insights into the spread and impact of the virus. By calculating these metrics, it enabled more reliable analysis.

    Data Visualization with Seaborn: To enhance the comprehension of the data outcomes, I utilized the Seaborn & matplot libraries for data visualization. By visualizing the data in a more intuitive and graphical manner, data becme more asy to understand
